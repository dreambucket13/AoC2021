My solutions to Advent of Code 2021

My overall goal is not speed.  If there is something I don't know how to do I'll go after that, even if it is not necessarily the ideal solution.

I also used this to brush up on my C.  Days 6-24 will be done in C.

# Most interesting problems:

## Day 6, the exponential lanternfish

I learned:
- When your first solution approaches the limits of the JVM, reconsider your approach
- When stuck, draw the problem ex. as a graph
- How to use the Java Random File Access class, only to learn just how slow file access is
- This is a big one for me.  My final solution in C was a recursive algorithm, something I had struggled with before.
- Big thanks to Steve Heindel for the code review and memoization tips

## Day 8, the crossed displays
- I think I could have spent more time solving the problem and less time playing with typedefs and data structures.  Try to use the data with minimal transformation
