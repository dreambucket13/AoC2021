Day 6 was interesting since this is the first time I have come across the physical limitations of my PC!

My solution for part 1 works, but once you get past 230 days or so, the array of fish exceeds the Java VM limit!

So, my next attempt will be to use files to store the fish data to remove (practically) the size limit.  I expect the speed to be much worse!
